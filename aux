--Ejercicio 2
--Sin pattern matching
eChica :: [[Integer]] -> [[Integer]]
eChica xs 
	| long xs > 1 && (head xs /= last xs) = [head xs ++ last xs] ++ eChica ( init (tail xs ) ) 
	| otherwise = xs

--Con pattern matching
eChica :: [[Integer]] -> [[Integer]]
eChica [] = []
eChica [a] = [a]
eChica (x:xs) = [ x ++ ult ] ++ eChica ( init xs )
	where ult = last xs
